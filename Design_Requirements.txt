MECKMAN DESIGN SYSTEM – VERSION 3.2

1. Brand Essence

The Meckman aesthetic represents precision framed through curiosity.
Every interaction should feel intentional, focused, and spatially grounded — like stepping into a small, illuminated chamber within a dark lab.

Keywords: Focus. Control. Discovery. Clarity in the dark.

2. Core Visual Theme
	•	Primary: Black (#000000) — endless space, clarity through contrast.
	•	Secondary: Charcoal (#2A2A2A) — structure and containment.
	•	Accents:
	•	Tan (#FFF2CC) — warmth, craftsmanship, and quiet refinement.
	•	Red (#CC0000) — curiosity spark; rare and deliberate.
	•	Text: White (#FFFFFF) and Light Gray (#CCCCCC) for hierarchy.

Usage Ratio: 70% Black / 20% Charcoal / 8% White & Gray / 2% Tan + Red.

3. Modals & Panels

Purpose

Modals and panels are the heart of Meckman UX.
They focus user attention, eliminate noise, and create intentional moments of interaction within the broader black canvas.
They’re not interruptions — they are frames for clarity.

Design Principles
	1.	Isolation by Darkness
	•	When a modal opens, the background dims to near-black (#000000 at 80–90% opacity).
	•	The modal emerges like a lit control surface — an “interface island.”
	2.	Rounded Corners Always
	•	All panels and modals have rounded corners between 10–14px.
	•	Corners soften the technical feel and make the space feel human-crafted.
	3.	Minimal Shadows
	•	Use subtle outer glows or light tan outlines instead of heavy shadows.
	•	Depth should feel optical, not layered.
	4.	Contained Hierarchy
	•	Each modal should express a single intent.
	•	No nested modals — instead, use stepwise progression or inline transitions.

Visual Treatment

Element	Color	Notes
Modal Background	Charcoal (#2A2A2A)	Main surface, matte finish
Border	Thin tan or red line (1–2px)	Defines focus and curiosity
Text	White (#FFFFFF)	Primary
Subtext / Labels	Light Gray (#CCCCCC)	Secondary
Button Area	Black or Tan	Clear separation at bottom of modal
Accent Detail	Single red icon, dot, or underline	Used sparingly as a curiosity cue


⸻

Modal Layout Standards
	•	Padding: 32px all sides minimum
	•	Corner Radius: 12px (never square)
	•	Max Width: 480–720px (desktop)
	•	Vertical Alignment: Centered on screen
	•	Responsive Behavior: Expands downward on mobile but preserves central focus

Example Modal Composition

[Header] — White text, clear title (e.g., “Connect Device”)
[Body] — Compact text block and 1–2 key inputs
[Actions] — Primary button (black), secondary (outlined tan)


⸻

Behavior
	•	Background behind modal becomes inert and darkened.
	•	Modal should not slide or bounce in — it should fade gently (200ms max).
	•	Closing actions should feel calm and deliberate (e.g., fade-out or dissolve).
	•	No stacking modals — each represents one complete microtask.

⸻

4. Layout & Structure
	•	The black background is the environment — everything lives against it.
	•	Panels and modals create focal areas within that environment.
	•	Each layer (page → panel → modal) represents increased focus.
	•	Use consistent vertical spacing (24–32px).
	•	Avoid clutter, outlines, or gradients except to define boundaries.

5. Components Summary

Component	Core Color	Behavior	Style
Card	Charcoal	Static	Rounded 8px, tan border
Panel	Charcoal	Slide or appear	Rounded 10px, thin tan border
Modal	Charcoal	Fade in	Rounded 12px, tan or red border
Button	Black / Tan	Hover invert	Rounded 6px
Input Field	Charcoal	Focus glow (tan)	Rounded 6px
Divider	Tan line at 20% opacity	—	Straight, centered spacing


⸻

6. Tone & Copy

Every modal or panel should:
	•	Speak clearly and directly.
	•	Begin with an action word (“Connect Device,” “Enter Location,” “Track Motion”).
	•	End with a clear decision (“Go,” “Save,” “Start”).
	•	Avoid uncertainty — the user should always know what will happen next.

7. Brand Signature

Trait	Translation
Precision	Strict alignment and spacing
Warmth	Tan borders and light touch of softness
Curiosity	Single red accent per view
Focus	Use of modals and panels as illuminated frames
Calm	Static layouts, no motion or clutter

Core Principle

“Every Meckman modal is a moment of clarity in a dark space.”

When you open one, the user should feel like the world goes quiet — and their task becomes obvious.
